# Kings Bounty

This is an extremely simple and rough game made in the Godot engine. This is my first time using Godot, my first time working with GDScript, and my first time attempting to make a game on my own. 

I am aware that there is most likely spaghetti code. I am working on this project without any knowledge of Godot best practices, using only Godot documentation as reference. I haven't made an attempt to clean up the code, and everything (including the art) is entirely my own.

### THE CODE WILL LOOK BAD. 
That is not my focus for this project. 

My focus for this project is to complete a game, no matter how small. Since I'm just starting off with game dev, I know that if I focus too much on the minutiae, then I will never finish the game. And if I never finish the game then I will never grow.

There is still work left to do on this project, it is not finished. I'll try to keep a list of tasks I want to complete, somewhere in this repository.

## Brief dicussion on the project, goals, and next steps

I may be getting ahead of myself, but for my next project after this one, I plan on finding a random guide on youtube and following along with it, taking what I learn from this project and expanding on that knowledge. 
My reasoning for that being my next step is as follows. 

First, I make something on my own, knowing nothing about what I'm doing and knowing nothing about what's good and bad. 
Then I follow along with someone who DOES know what they're doing, and I read up on what is good and bad. 
If I just jumped into watching and following along with someone else then all I'd end up making is the exact same game they made. 
But if I go into it, already having some knowledge of the engine and of how to make a game, I can follow along and add some of my own flair into the mix. Instead of making the same game, I'd be making a similar game.

For me personally, that's very important. As I learn how to develop games and use Godot, I want to make sure that I am still present. I want to make sure that my personality exists in whatever I make.
